File to Plan what to do, instructions etc

Main Window is self explanatory, this is where the user interacts with the software

How its going to work:
	-User can input a slot from which a 'time class' is created to make set times that things must happen e.g. School every weekday 8-3
	==> These act as constraints to what the program can generate e.g if school is there it isnt a good time to revise (in school)

	-User can then input what they want the program to add, giving any constraints e.g. 4 hrs of exercise a week, program decides when

	After a suitable timetable is generated, the user can save, edit and print their timetable
